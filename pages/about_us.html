           <p class="textAboutUs"><i id="number">1974</i>. We are riders—that fact has guided our every decision since 1974. When quality tires weren't around, we strove to make the best. When people wanted to ride cruisers in the dirt, we made the first production mountain bike. When roadies wanted to go faster, we doubled-down on carbon and built our own wind tunnel. And when we saw kids struggling to focus in school, we began supporting Outride to help promote better health through cycling.Specialized. Made for riders, by riders.</p>

    			<p>The company was founded in 1974 by Mike Sinyard,a cycling enthusiast who sold his Volkswagen Bus for $1,500 to fund a cycle tour of Europe, where he bought handlebars and stems made by Cinelli to take back to the US. Sinyard started out importing Italian bike components that were difficult to find in the United States, but the company began to produce its own bike parts by 1976, starting with the Specialized Touring Tire.In 1981, the company introduced its first two bikes, the Sequoia, a sport-touring design and the Allez, a road bike.
    			Specialized also introduced the first major production mountain bike in the world, the Stumpjumper, in 1981. Like the Sequoia and Allez, the Stumpjumper was designed by Tim Neenan and based on an early Tom Ritchey design. Specialized continues to produce bikes under the Stumpjumper name, including both hardtail and full-suspension models.</p>

In the early 1990s, Specialized introduced the Globe line of urban bikes. The line was the subject of a major relaunch in 2009, which saw Globe become its own distinct brand.The Globe brand has since been discontinued, and Specialized now markets "lifestyle" bikes under its main brand.A 2008 Specialized Stumpjumper with full suspension.A 2008 Specialized S-Works Transition carbon Triathlon/Time Trial bike.In 1995, Specialized launched the Full Force brand.Full Force was a lower-end mountain bike brand sold through sporting goods stores and discount retailers such as Costco.</p>
